    ### Closed by a decision of the user, 2026-08-16

    The user decided: do NOT build this. We rely on the upstream work of other
    people to give us the capability.

    No code changes. No API design. No matching change in `FoundationModelsRouter`.

    ## What stays true, for whoever opens this again

    - The capability is implemented one layer down and cannot be reached from the
      surface a FoundationModels host builds on. `MTPSpeculativeTokenIterator`,
      `MTPDrafterModel` and `MTPDrafterTypeRegistry` are all in `MLXLMCommon`.
      `MLXFoundationModels.MLXLanguageModel` takes `configuration`, `capabilities`,
      `weightsLocation` and `load`, and names no drafter.
    - The error that started the card is correct behavior, not a defect.
      `qwen3_5_mtp` is registered two times, and both are drafter registrations, thus
      `.unsupportedModelType` was the correct answer to a pin of that type as a
      primary model.
    - The value argument, from the peer session that filed the card: decode speed is
      the dominant cost of each of their scenarios. The tool work is about 3 seconds
      of a 300-second scenario, and the remainder generates at 10 to 14 tokens each
      second.
    - The peer states the priority is low. Nothing of theirs is blocked, and they
      will not chase the card.

    Reopen this only if upstream does not deliver and a consumer becomes blocked.

title: MLXLanguageModel cannot be given an MTP drafter, so speculative decoding is unreachable from a FoundationModels host
---
Filed from the `FoundationModelsMultitool` session. Evidence and requirement only; the design is yours.

## What was tried

Pinned `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-MTP-mxfp4` as the generation model for a gated real-model suite, to measure MTP speed and accuracy against `Qwen3.8-27B-mxfp4` and `Muse-Glimmer-30B-mxfp4`. Every scenario failed at resolution in about half a second:

    .unsupportedModelType("qwen3_5_mtp")

## Why that is correct behaviour, not a bug

`qwen3_5_mtp` is registered twice in this repository, and both registrations are drafter registrations:

    Libraries/MLXLLM/Qwen35TextMTPRegistration.swift:20-21
        await MTPDrafterTypeRegistry.shared.registerModelType("qwen3_5_mtp", ...)
    Libraries/MLXVLM/Qwen35VLMMTPRegistration.swift:23-24
        await MTPDrafterTypeRegistry.shared.registerModelType("qwen3_5_mtp", ...)

Never with the primary model-type registry. `MTPDrafterModel`'s own documentation says what it is — "Protocol for Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) speculative drafter models", with a `target` parameter documented as "The main language model this drafter is speculating for".

So the model was pinned wrongly on our side. An MTP repo is a draft model that runs beside a base model and proposes tokens the base verifies; the speed-up is a property of the pairing. Nothing here needs fixing for that.

## The actual gap

The pairing is not expressible from a `FoundationModels` host.

`MLXFoundationModels.MLXLanguageModel` is what a host builds a `LanguageModelSession` over — our CLI does exactly that, at `CLIRunner.makeMLXLanguageModel(for:)`, and the gated suite reuses that same production wiring. Its initializer takes `configuration`, `capabilities`, `weightsLocation` and `load`. There is no drafter parameter, and no speculative-decoding option anywhere in `Libraries/MLXFoundationModels`:

    rg 'drafter|draft|speculat' Libraries/MLXFoundationModels/*.swift
    (no matches)

`MTPSpeculativeTokenIterator`, `MTPDrafterModel` and `MTPDrafterTypeRegistry` all live in `MLXLMCommon`, one layer below what a FoundationModels host consumes. So the capability exists and is unreachable through the surface we use.

`FoundationModelsRouter` has the same gap on its side — its loader exposes no drafter either — so a fix here does not land end to end without a matching change there. That half is theirs; this card is only about whether `MLXLanguageModel` can express a drafter at all.

## What would settle it

Some way for a host constructing an `MLXLanguageModel` to name a drafter repo alongside the target, so `loadModelContainer` (or whatever it delegates to) can build the target, build the drafter from `MTPDrafterTypeRegistry`, and drive `MTPSpeculativeTokenIterator` instead of the plain iterator. The shape is yours to choose — a parameter, a configuration type, or an inferred pairing from repo naming.

## Why it is worth having

Unmeasurable today. That is the point of the card: MTP claims a decode speed-up, and this repository has the implementation, but no consumer above `MLXLMCommon` can turn it on, so the claim cannot be tested by anyone building on `MLXFoundationModels`.

If a host is already meant to reach it some other way, saying so closes this card and we will use that path instead.

## Measured context, for sizing only

On the same hardware, one full gated run each through `MLXLanguageModel`:

    Muse-Glimmer-30B-mxfp4     ~10-14 tokens/second, search-then-call x4 in 283-299s
    Qwen3.8-27B-mxfp4          faster per scenario, search-then-call x4 in 265.6s

Decode speed is the dominant cost in every scenario we run — tool work is about 3 seconds of a 300-second scenario — so a real MTP speed-up would matter more here than any other optimisation available.
